## General info

This report will be targeted to people who are looking to relocate to London. Inorder to finalise a neighborhood to hunt for an apartment, safety is considered as a top concern when moving to a new place. If you don’t feel safe in your own home, you’re not going to be able to enjoy living there. The crime statistics will provide an insight into this issue.

Preprocessed a real world data set from Kaggle showing the London Crimes from 2008 to 2016
