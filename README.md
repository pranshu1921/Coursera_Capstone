# The Battle of Neighborhoods

This repo contains the Capstone Project - The Battle of the Neighborhoods Applied Data Science Capstone by IBM/Coursera

Introduction: Business Problem This project aims to select the safest borough in London based on the total crimes, explore the neighborhoods of that borough to find the 10 most common venues in each neighborhood and finally cluster the neighborhoods using k-mean clustering.

This report will be targeted to people who are looking to relocate to London. Inorder to finalise a neighborhood to hunt for an apartment, safety is considered as a top concern when moving to a new place. If you don’t feel safe in your own home, you’re not going to be able to enjoy living there. The crime statistics will provide an insight into this issue.
